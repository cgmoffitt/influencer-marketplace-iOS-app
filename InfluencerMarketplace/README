Instructions:

The app should open preloaded with all necessary data. (Pictures are preloaded in Assets and the Sound file is preloaded under Sounds).
All of the data regarding which influencers and prizes are on the platform are also hardcoded into the file ExampleData.

The primary "model" of this app is one user. It is found in the User.swift file. The "view model" will be found in the UserViewModel.swift file.
This app is essentially a prototype of what the experience would be for one single user (follower, not influencer).

There are 4 main functional aspects of this app.

1) Scroll through influencers you follow and view their page.
The app opens in the My Follows view. The influencers you follow are preloaded. Scroll through and click on one to view their page and their prizes

2) "Win a prize"
While scrolling through an influencer's available "prizes" on their page, click on the redeem button to "win" it if you have enough points.
If you click on a redeem button for a prize you already have, an Alert will appear saying you already have this prize.
If you click on a redeem button for a prize that you can't afford, an Alert will appear telling you so.
If you click on a redeem button for a prize you don't have and can afford, a sheet will appear prompting you to slide up on the Prize view in order to
confirm your "win." If you slide up, you will have purchased the prize, and a congratulations message will be displayed with explit animation on the sheet
and a sparkle sound effect will play.
All purchases you make will be saved in user defaults
